Genetic data are available on Zenodo ([DOI/10.5281](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.6434681)).

The snps folder should contain the three vcf files:
- Bathycoccus-prasinos_08-5_snp.vcf
- Pelagomonas-calceolata_08-5_snp.vcf
- Phaeocystis-cordata_08-5_snp.vcf
as well as the `coverage` folder that should contain the three txt files:
- coverage_Bathycoccus-prasinos_08-5
- coverage_Pelagomonas-calceolata_08-5
- coverage_Phaeocystis-cordata_08-5
