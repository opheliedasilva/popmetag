## Summary
Since a decade, high-throughput sequencing has transformed the study of marine planktonic communities and has highlighted the extent of protist diversity in these ecosystems. Still, little is known about their genetic diversity at the species-scale and about their major speciation mechanisms. As data from large scale samplings are now available, we postulate that metagenomics could contribute to deciphering the processes shaping protist genetic differentiation in the marine realm. As a proof of concept, we developed a FAIR pipeline and focused on the Mediterranean Sea to study three a priori abundant protist species: Bathycoccus prasinos, Pelagomonas calceolata and Phaeocystis cordata. We compared the genetic differentiation of each species in light of geographical, environmental and oceanographic distances. We highlighted that isolation-by-environment shape the genetic differentiation of Bathycoccus prasinos whereas Phaeocystis cordata is impacted by isolation-by-distance. At present time, the use of metagenomics to accurately estimate the genetic differentiation of protists remains challenging since resulting coverages are lower compared to traditional population surveys. However we started here to shed light on ecological and evolutionary processes occurring within natural marine populations, and paved the way for future protist population studies exploiting metagenomics.
