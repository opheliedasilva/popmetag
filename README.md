## Summary

Since a decade, high-throughput sequencing has transformed the study of marine planktonic communities and has highlighted the extent of protist diversity in these ecosystems. Still, little is known about their genetic diversity at the species-scale and about their major speciation mechanisms. As data from large scale samplings are now available, we postulate that metagenomics could contribute to deciphering the processes shaping protist genetic differentiation in the marine realm. As a proof of concept, we developed a FAIR pipeline and focused on the Mediterranean Sea to study three *a priori* abundant protist species: *Bathycoccus prasinos*, *Pelagomonas calceolata* and *Phaeocystis cordata*. We compared the genetic differentiation of each species in light of geographical, environmental and oceanographic distances. We highlighted that isolation-by-environment shape the genetic differentiation of *Bathycoccus prasinos* whereas *Phaeocystis cordata* is impacted by isolation-by-distance. At present time, the use of metagenomics to accurately estimate the genetic differentiation of protists remains challenging since resulting coverages are lower compared to traditional population surveys. However we started here to shed light on ecological and evolutionary processes occurring within natural marine populations, and paved the way for future protist population studies exploiting metagenomics. <br/> **Keywords**: Metagenomics; Genetic differentiation; Protists; Marine plankton; Mediterranean Sea.

## Description

The objective of our study was to develop an original, bioinformatic pipeline aiming to exploit the currently available metagenomic data for characterizing genetic differentiation of protists in the ecosystems. We focused on three planktonic protistan species a priori abundant in the Mediterranean Sea, which is an ideal location to study population genetics.  By gathering reference sequences and metagenomics data previously published, we investigated the genetic differentiation at the species scale and then if this one could be related to external drivers (*i.e.,* geography, environmental conditions and oceanographic circulation). The contrasted results for the three species leading us to discuss how current metagenomics could support and provide new resources for population genetics.
